		<h1>Using Vim</h1>
		<p>
			Vim is a powerful text editor that can be used to write code, edit text,
			and more.
		</p>
		<p>
			You press i key to enter insert mode. And you press a key to enter append
			mode.
		</p>
		<p>You press ESC key to back to normal mode.</p>
		<h2>Quitting Vim :q</h2>
		<p>
			Yet, perhaps, the most important thing for layman is to know how to quit
			vim. Actually, you don't need to memorize that; it is just the q key. But
			you need to add a suffix of : to it. Here, the ":" means that you are now
			entering the command-line mode. Yes, in a word, it is ":q" for you to quit
			vim.
		</p>
		<h2>Mapping</h2>
		<p>
			For many people, the esc and ctrl are far away, so they map these two keys
			to CapsLock key. In this case, you can tap capslock to trigger esc, back
			to the normal mode. And you can long press capslocak to trigger ctrl.
