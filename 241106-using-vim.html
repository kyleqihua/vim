		<h1>Using Vim</h1>
		<p>
			Vim is a powerful text editor that can be used to write code, edit text,
			and more.
		</p>
		<p>
			You press i key to enter insert mode. And you press a key to enter append
			mode.
		</p>
		<p>You press ESC key to back to normal mode.</p>
		<h2>Quitting Vim :q</h2>
		<p>
			Yet, perhaps, the most important thing for layman is to know how to quit
			vim. Actually, you don't need to memorize that; it is just the q key. But
			you need to add a suffix of : to it. Here, the ":" means that you are now
			entering the command-line mode. Yes, in a word, it is ":q" for you to quit
			vim.
